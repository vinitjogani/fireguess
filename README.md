# fireguess

Fireguess is a simple Android game that fetches the top 50 songs from the billboard, translates the name of the song to Hindi and the user needs to guess the actual title of the song. It's fun and amusing because the titles of well-known English songs sometimes translate funnily to Hindi, and it's a great game to have fun with a bunch of friends. It is made using Cordova API.
